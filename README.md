# Michael Monica
Student at Juniata College
## Background
I was born in Hagerstown, Maryland in the year 2003 growing up right across the Mason-Dixon line in Greencastle, Pennsylvania. After finishing my education in the local public school district of Greencastle I would decide to continue my education at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania.
## Education
My POE at Juniata College is History & Museum Studies, which I am always told is an interesting combo. I have always had an interest in museums since I was a child and saw it as the best career path for me, so when deciding on where to go to school I gravitated towards Juniata as it had a unique Museum Studies program. I am now in my senior year, expecting to graduate spring 2025.
